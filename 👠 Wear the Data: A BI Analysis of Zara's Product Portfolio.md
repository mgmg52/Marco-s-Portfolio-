### Key insights gained

The dataset contains 252 unique products and there are no missing value in any critical field, so we can trust its completeness.                                                                                    However, there is a strong imbalance in products offerings as 218 products are classified under the Men's section, while only 34 under Women's section. Moreover, all the five terms appear in the Men's section, whereas the Women's section includes only sweaters.                                                                                                                                                                  This inbalanced assortment gives an important context the correctly interpretate the following KPIs.

## B. KPIs Analysis: Zara Portfolio Performance

### 1B. Promotional Lift Rate by Section and Terms

- Metric: AVG(sales_volume WHERE promotion = 'Yes') / AVG(sales_volume WHERE promotion = 'No') - 1
- Business question: Which section and term should Zara allocate more promotional budget to?
- Why is this KPI relevant ?: Although Zara is not known as much as its competitor for this policy, the fast fashion industry is well-known for its discount culture. Namely they run (almost) endless promotions all over the year. Tracking promotional lift rate by section, that is comparing the sales volume promoted vs. unpromoted items within the same section and terms, can help to get a better understanding of Zara portfolio performance, by acquiring valuable insights on relative performance patterns.
