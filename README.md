ðŸ‘  [ Wear the Data: A BI Analysis of Zara's Product Portfolio](https://github.com/mgmg52/Marco-s-Portfolio-/blob/main/%F0%9F%91%A0%20Wear%20the%20Data%3A%20A%20BI%20Analysis%20of%20Zara's%20Product%20Portfolio.md#-wear-the-data-a-bi-analysis-of-zaras-product-portfolio)

**Description:** The main goal of this project is to examine Zaraâ€™s product portfolio to get useful insights on how Zara can maximize promotional effectiviness and optimize it for maximum sales impact. We compute 4 main KPIs leveraging SQL and, then, information and insights acquired are visualized using Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

**Original dataset:** [Download zara_sales.csv](./zara_sales.csv)

**Skills:** Analytical thinking, Data analysis, Data visualization                                                                                                                                                    

**Hard skills:** SQL, Power BI      

**Power BI visualization:** [Wear the Data](https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=4f9e9096-7a12-42e1-8d3c-251a373a36a5&autoAuth=true&ctid=5a4ba6f9-f531-4f32-9467-398f19e69de4)

**Results:** This analysis confirms that clothing categories alone arenâ€™t driving Zaraâ€™s performance and way more even distributed across revenue quartile than previously. Moreover, each segment (seasonalâ€¯Ã—â€¯promo) contributes roughly the same share of revenue, highlighting a very balanced and sustainable revenue flow.  
Regarding promotions, while these items generate just over half of total revenue, promotional lift is negative except for sweaters. Jackets dominate simply by volume and discounting, not superior promo effectiveness. 

Based on this, Zara should rethink its promo budget allocation, prioritizing sweaters slice and shifting from broader discount across categories to extremely targeted campaigns. The company should also maintain its balanced mix by focusing on assortment and budget alliocation on finer attrivutes, rather than hopelesslly searching for a magic, profitable category that can fit all.
